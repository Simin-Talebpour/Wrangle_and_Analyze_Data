# Wrangle and Analyze Data
Udacity Nanodegree Data Analysis Project - Term 2  

# Project Details
Your tasks in this project are as follows:

* Data wrangling, which consists of:
  * Gathering data  
  * Assessing data  
  * Cleaning data  

* Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data  
* Reporting on
 1. your data wrangling efforts and   
 2) your data analyses and visualizations    

# Gathering Data for this Project
Gather each of the three pieces of data as described below in a Jupyter Notebook titled wrangle_act.ipynb:

1. The WeRateDogs Twitter archive. This file(twitter_archive_enhanced.csv) is given to you, so imagine it as a file on hand. 
This dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

2. The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file (image_predictions.tsv) is hosted on Udacity's servers and should be downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following URL: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv

3. Each tweet's retweet count and favorite ("like") count at minimum, and any additional data you find interesting. Using the tweet IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called tweet_json.txt file. Each tweet's JSON data should be written to its own line. Then read this .txt file line by line into a pandas DataFrame with (at minimum) tweet ID, retweet count, and favorite count. Note: do not include your Twitter API keys, secrets, and tokens in your project submission.

# Cleaning Data for this Project
Clean each of the issues you documented while assessing. Perform this cleaning in wrangle_act.ipynb as well. The result should be a high quality and tidy master pandas DataFrame (or DataFrames, if appropriate). Again, the issues that satisfy the Project Motivation must be cleaned.

# Storing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Data for this Project
Store the clean DataFrame(s) in a CSV file with the main one named twitter_archive_master.csv. If additional files exist because multiple tables are required for tidiness, name these files appropriately. Additionally, you may store the cleaned data in a SQLite database (which is to be submitted as well if you do).  
Analyze and visualize your wrangled data in your wrangle_act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. At least three (3) insights and one (1) visualization must be produced.

# Reporting for this Project
Create a 300-600 word written report called wrangle_report.pdf or wrangle_report.html that briefly describes your wrangling efforts. This is to be framed as an internal document.  

Create a 250-word-minimum written report called act_report.pdf or act_report.html that communicates the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from your wrangled data. This is to be framed as an external document, like a blog post or magazine article, for example.  

Both of these documents can be created in separate Jupyter Notebooks using the Markdown functionality of Jupyter Notebooks.

# What Software Do I Need?

You need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook on your computer.
The following packages (libraries) need to be installed. 
pandas  
NumPy  
requests  
tweepy  
json  
You need to be able to create written documents that contain images and you need to be able to export these documents as PDF files. This task can be done in a Jupyter Notebook, but you might prefer to use a word processor like Google Docs, which is free, or Microsoft Word.
A text editor, like Sublime, which is free, will be useful but is not required.
